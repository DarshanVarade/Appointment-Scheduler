## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

* Node.js (v18.x or higher recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager)
* MongoDB (local installation or a cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas)
* Postman (for API testing)

### **Installation & Setup**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd appointment-scheduler
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables. This file is ignored by Git for security.

    ```env
    # Server Configuration
    PORT=3000
    CORS_ORIGIN=*

    # Database Configuration
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
    DB_NAME=appointment-scheduler

    # JWT Secrets
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_super_secret_access_token
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=1d
    REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_super_secret_refresh_token
    REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=10d

    # Email Configuration (for Nodemailer)
    EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
    EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password
    ```

### **Running the Application**

* **Development Mode**: To run the server with `nodemon` for automatic restarts on file changes:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

* **Production Mode**: To run the server in a production environment:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The server will start on the port specified in your `.env` file (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
